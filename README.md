# ShiftCheckbox jQuery plugin

This jQuery plugin can perform the following checkbox-related functions:

- Shift+click to select/deselect ranges of checkboxes, like in GMail
- Handling the events of one or more "Select all" checkboxes
- Passing clicks from a "row" element that contains a checkbox to the checkbox
  itself
